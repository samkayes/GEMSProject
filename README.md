# GEMSProject
Final project for CS 3105
GEMS is an attendance checker that doubles as an employee roster

The group used React JS for the frontend, Laravel for the backend/API, and PHPmyadmin as database.
The ReactJS and Laravel are in two separate folders, in order to run the app:
run _php artisan serve_ in the Laravel folder
run  _npm run start____ in the React JS folder_
